## About

This Shiny web app provides a dashboard for economic researchers to perform industry cluster analysis and derive insights regarding regional economic productivity and competitiveness. 

For more information regarding the theory of industry clusters, see:

This web app is a project of the [Taiwan Institute for Strategy and Competitiveness](http://tisc.nccu.edu.tw/) at [National Chengchi University](http://www.nccu.edu.tw/?locale=en) in Taipei.

## Setup

### Software Dependencies

In order to run this web app, you need to have the [R language](https://www.r-project.org/), [RStudio IDE](https://www.rstudio.com/), and the following R packages installed:
* [dplyr](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=dplyr)
* [googleVis](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=googleVis)
* [leaflet](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=leaflet)
* [shinydashboard](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=shinydashboard)

Install R packages using function `install.packages()`. For example:

```r
install.packages('shinydashboard')
```

### Folder Structure

Make sure that the file structure on your machine matches the following:

```
├── bizcluster-dashboard
|   ├── scripts
|   | ├── calculated_metrics.R
|   ├── html
|   | ├── employ-growth-comp.html
|   | ├── employ-growth-spec.html
|   | ├── employ-share-spec.html
|   | ├── rev-growth-spec.html
|   ├── data 
|   | ├── topojson 
|   ├── server.R
|   ├── ui.R
└──
```
**Note that the folder `data` does not exist on the GitHub repository.** Prior to running the application, create the folder `data` and populate it with input data to be processed and visualized by the dashboard. Folder `data` should contain CSV files with industry cluster data, as well as one CSV file with clusters labeled as "traded" or "local". Folder `data/topojson` should contain a separate TopoJSON file for each geographic region that you want to visualize.
